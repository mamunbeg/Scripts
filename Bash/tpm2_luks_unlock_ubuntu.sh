# Full disk encryption on Linux using LUKS+TPM2 
#
# Heavily modified, but based on:
# https://run.tournament.org.il/ubuntu-18-04-and-tpm2-encrypted-system-disk/
#
# Updated 2022/04/29
# -Automated comparison of root.key and TPM values
# -Added support for multiple encrypted volumes by using the volume name for the temp file in tpm2-getkey
# -Tested with Ubuntu 22.04.  Works as expected for LVM, but does not work for ZFS encryption
#
# -Added more output
# Created 2020/07/13
# This assumes a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 install that was configured with full disk LUKS encryption at install so it requires a password to unlock the disk at boot.
# This will create a new 64 character random password, add it to LUKS, store it in the TPM, and modify initramfs to pull it from the TPM automatically at boot.
